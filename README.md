This is an apartment hire web project where you can do all CRUD operations on your blocks, apartments and contracts. You have to choose block for adding an apartment. For adding contract you have to choose an apartment. You just need to sign up and sign in for that. You need to add SQL backup file to your Microsoft SQL Server 
application for using this project. I used serilog(for logging), Entity Framework Core(as an ORM framework) with database first approach, Microsoft SQL 
Server(as a database), jQuery(for client side validation) and so on.
